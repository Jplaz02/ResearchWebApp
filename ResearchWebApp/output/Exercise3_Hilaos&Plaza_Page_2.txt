o Disinformation and Misinformation: Social media allows fake news to spread
quickly, often influencing public opinion and elections. For example, during the
2016 Philippine elections, social media was used to promote misleading
narratives that shaped voter behavior.

o Hate Speech: Platforms amplify hate speech, creating division and violence.
Online attacks on journalists and critics, such as those directed at reporters
covering sensitive issues, undermine press freedom and the credibility of
independent journalism.

o Polarization: The rapid spread of partisan content on platforms like Facebook
deepens political divides, weakening public trust in institutions like the judiciary
and the media. This undermines democracy by fostering a climate of distrust and
division.

What do you think are the repercussions of democratic institutions and free press
weakened by disinformation, misinformation, hate speech, and mass deception?

Disinformation, misinformation, hate speech, and mass deception undermine
democratic institutions and the free press by causing people to lose trust in the
government and the media, dividing society, halting open discussions, unfairly
influencing elections, spreading false health information, harming people’s mental
health, damaging businesses, and making the country less safe, all of which harm
democracy and social stability.

Should social media platforms be held legally accountable for the spread of
disinformation, misinformation, hate speech, and mass deception? Should the
Philippines pass a law for this purpose? Why or why not?

Yes, Social media platforms play a major role in spreading harmful content. Holding
them legally accountable encourages them to take action against disinformation and
hate speech, just as traditional media is held responsible for harmful content. Passing a
law in the Philippines would ensure platforms take their responsibility seriously by
moderating content properly, while also protecting users' freedom of speech. The law
should promote responsible regulation without stifling legitimate debate.

Senator Pangilinan calls on all Filipinos, regardless of political beliefs, “to join in the fight
against disinformation, misinformation, hate speech, and mass deception via digital
platforms.” How have you personally done this in the past? How do you plan to do
better at this in the future?
