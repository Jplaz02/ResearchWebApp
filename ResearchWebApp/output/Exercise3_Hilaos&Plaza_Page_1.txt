Exercise 3

Enrichment Questions:

1. Inthe press release, Senator Pangilinan refers to disinformation, misinformation, hate
speech, and mass deception as (a) the COVID-19 variants of the digital world, (b) biggest
man-made threats to modern Philippine society, and (c) digital wildfires. In what ways
do you think these parallels hold true:

a. the COVID-19 variants of the digital world
- Disinformation, like COVID-19, travels quickly and adapts to new situations,
resulting in broad harm. It thrives on vulnerabilities like human psychology,
biases, and unregulated digital platforms. Disinformation erodes public trust,
causes confusion, and damages societal cohesion, necessitating collective effort
to combat effectively.

b. biggest man-made threats to modern Philippine society
- Disinformation and associated concerns are man-made problems that employ
technology to convey divisive messages. In the Philippines, these dangers
weaken democratic institutions, polarize the populace, and erode trust in the
free press. Troll farms, fake news factories, and organized propaganda efforts
are planned behaviors that cause society harm, making them significant
challenges in the digital age.

c. digital wildfires
- Like wildfires, disinformation can quickly consume public discourse, destroying
trust, credibility, and confidence in institutions. It's tough to contain once
misleading information spreads online because it's practically impossible to put
out, with residual "embers" remaining even after debunking. This analogy
highlights the difficulty of containment in online communication.

. How do you think social media platforms and the rapid advance of technology threaten
demacratic institutions and the free press in the Philippines? Cite examples for each.

- Social media platforms and advancing technology pose significant threats to democratic
institutions and the free press in the Philippines by enabling the spread of
disinformation, misinformation, and hate speech.
